# Phoca - Inkscape Save As
 Inkscape extension to export images to JPG, WEBP, AVIF or PNG format


Phoca - Inkscape Save As extension is an Inkscape extension which allows you to export your image(s) to JPG, WEBP, AVIF or PNG format. As default, Inkscape can export images to PNG but there is no option to export them to JPG or WEBP or AVIF format.

There exist two GitHub projects that deal with the export of Inkscape images to JPG format but both are not more up-to-date for the newest Inkscape version.

Phoca - Inkscape Save As extension is inspired by both projects. It uses some code from both projects which was transformed to new Inkscape API and adds new options.
